## Part of JS Program
+ Engine : responsible for start to finish compilation and execution js program
+ Compiler : handles parsing and code generation
+ Scope manager: collects and maintains a lookup list of all the declared variables/identifiers, enforce a set of rules as to how these are accesible, each block has its own scope manager



## 2 Phases
- initial identifiers and blocks scope(compiler to scope manager)
- assign value to the identifiers(engine to scopoe manager)
